HTML Elements teaches you the types of HTML elements. It also highlights the difference between HTML tags and HTML elements that are often confused. HTML Basic Tags are used to structure website content (text, hyperlinks, images, media, etc). Tags only "instruct" browsers how to show the content of the web page.

Our next HTML Color Names chapter shows the ways of changing the color of the text in HTML. Also, find a 216 cross-browser color palette used for creating pages of websites. HTML Tables section suggests the list of deprecated attributes, which means that they are no longer used in the mentioned tags and are replaced by other alternative attributes.
